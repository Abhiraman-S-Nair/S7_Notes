# A Basic Crawler Algorithm

## Overview
A web crawler, also known as a spider or robot, is a program that systematically navigates the web to download web pages. Crawlers form a fundamental part of search engines and various business intelligence applications.

## Flow of a Basic Crawler Algorithm
1. **Frontier Initialization**:
   - The crawler maintains a list of unvisited URLs, called the *frontier*, which is initialized with *seed URLs*.

2. **Iteration Process**:
   - During each iteration, the crawler selects the next URL from the frontier.
   - The page associated with the URL is fetched using an HTTP request.
   - The retrieved page is parsed to extract additional URLs.
   - Newly discovered URLs are added to the frontier.

3. **Storage and Processing**:
   - The fetched pages are stored locally for further processing and analysis.

## Key Considerations
- **Breadth-First Crawling**: A breadth-first crawler uses a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue, visiting URLs in the order they were discovered.
- **Best-First Crawling**: A priority-based frontier where pages are visited according to assigned priority values based on relevance or freshness.

# Breadth-First Crawlers

## Overview
Breadth-first crawling is a fundamental crawling technique where URLs are explored level-by-level, ensuring that all URLs at the current level are visited before moving deeper.

## Approach
1. **Frontier as a FIFO Queue**:
   - The frontier maintains discovered URLs in a FIFO queue.
   - The oldest URL is picked first, aligning with the breadth-first traversal concept.

2. **Advantages**:
   - Uniform exploration of the web with minimal bias.
   - Simple and straightforward implementation.

3. **Disadvantages**:
   - Less efficient in capturing high-priority pages.
   - May lead to higher storage and processing requirements.

## Use Cases
Breadth-first crawlers are suitable for applications focusing on comprehensive and unbiased coverage, such as universal search engines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Focused Crawlers

## Overview
Focused crawlers are designed to gather pages related to specific topics or categories. They aim to selectively explore only relevant areas of the web.

## Strategies
1. **Soft Focused Strategy**:
   - Each crawled page is assigned a relevance score, which acts as the priority value for new URLs.

2. **Hard Focused Strategy**:
   - URLs are classified strictly based on their relevance to pre-defined categories.

3. **Context-Focused Crawling**:
   - Uses context graphs and classifiers to estimate the relevance of URLs based on their distance from target pages.

## Use Cases
- Gathering domain-specific content for specialized search engines.
- Building targeted datasets for machine learning applications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Topical Crawlers

## Overview
Topical crawlers are designed to preferentially explore areas of the web related to a given topic of interest. Unlike traditional search engines, topical crawlers fetch and analyze pages in real-time.

## Key Features
1. **Relevance Cues**:
   - Topical crawlers utilize cues from words and hyperlinks on web pages to infer content relevance.

2. **Link-Cluster Conjecture**:
   - The assumption that linked pages are likely to share similar content is central to topical crawling.

3. **Best-First Crawling**:
   - Topical crawlers often implement a priority queue based on text similarity between a seed page and a candidate page.

## Pros and Cons
- **Advantages**: Fresh results and precise focus.
- **Drawbacks**: Slow compared to traditional crawlers as real-time analysis is required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Adaptive Crawlers

## Overview
Adaptive crawlers are advanced crawlers designed to adjust their behavior based on the observed patterns in the web. They employ machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques to improve crawling efficiency and relevance.

## Key Characteristics
1. **Use of Machine Learning**:
   - Adaptive crawlers utilize various machine learning techniques such as Bayesian classification, reinforcement learning, and neural networks.
   - These techniques help the crawler learn the relevance of pages and adapt its crawling strategy accordingly.

2. **Context-Based Adaptation**:
   - Cues from link context, anchor text, and neighboring pages are used to prioritize and filter new URLs.
   - Crawlers dynamically update their priorities as new evidence is gathered.

## Techniques Employed
1. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Adaptive crawlers use states and actions modeled as nodes and edges in a graph.
   - A function is used to estimate the value of a link, which helps decide the best actions to take.

2. **InfoSpiders**:
   - An example of an adaptive crawler employing a neural network to evaluate and rank URLs.
   - It uses a list of keywords initialized with a topic description and adjusts them as new pages are fetched.

## Advantages
- Adaptive crawlers improve the efficiency of focused crawling by learning from previous pages.
- They optimize crawling behavior dynamically based on changing web content.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
