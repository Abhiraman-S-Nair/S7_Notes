# Wrapper Generation and Preliminaries

## Introduction
Wrapper generation is the process of creating automated programs called wrappers to extract structured information from web pages. Wrappers are essential for processing semi-structured data, often presented in fixed templates.

## Types of Data-Rich Pages
1. **List Pages**: Contain lists of data records, typically formatted uniformly with repetitive structures. Examples include product listings and job postings.
2. **Detail Pages**: Provide detailed information about a single object, such as product details or a news article.

## Challenges
- Variations in web page structures.
- Handling nested or composite data records.

# Wrapper Induction

## Overview
Wrapper induction refers to the use of supervised learning techniques to generate rules for data extraction from web pages. The process involves manually labeling examples and training a system to identify similar structures.

## Steps in Wrapper Induction
1. **Data Labeling**: Users label examples of the target data in training pages.
2. **Rule Learning**: The system learns extraction rules based on the labeled examples. These rules often rely on the occurrence of landmarks like HTML tags or sequences of tokens.
3. **Application**: The learned rules are applied to extract data from other pages with similar structures.

## Example Systems
- **WIEN** (Kushmerick et al., 1997) and **Stalker** (Muslea et al., 1999) are prominent wrapper induction systems.

# Instance-Based Wrapper Learning

## Introduction
Instance-based wrapper learning involves creating extraction rules based on individual data examples. The process focuses on refining rules to cover new positive instances and exclude negative ones.

## Sequential Covering
The system iteratively learns rules to cover as many positive examples as possible without capturing negatives. Each extraction rule consists of:
1. **Start Rule**: Identifies the beginning of the data item.
2. **End Rule**: Identifies the end of the data item.

## Refinement Techniques
1. **Landmark Refinement**: Extends the size of landmarks by adding more tokens.
2. **Topology Refinement**: Adds new one-token landmarks.

# Automatic Wrapper Generation: Problems

## Challenges in Wrapper Generation
1. **Manual Labeling**: Supervised wrapper generation requires manual labeling, making it impractical for large-scale applications.
2. **High Maintenance**: Web pages often change templates, causing existing wrappers to break.

## Solutions: Unsupervised Extraction
- Data records are often encoded using a small set of templates, making it possible to identify and extract them using repeated patterns. Automatic extraction methods aim to minimize manual intervention by detecting and utilizing these patterns.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# String Matching and Tree Matching

## String Matching
String matching techniques identify and align sequences of characters based on similarity measures like Levenshtein distance. These methods are effective for flat data records.

## Tree Matching
Tree matching compares the structures of two trees, computing the minimum set of operations (insertion, deletion, replacement) needed to transform one tree into another.

### Example: Simple Tree Matching (STM)
- STM is a top-down algorithm that produces the maximum matching between two trees using dynamic programming techniques.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Building DOM Trees

## Overview
DOM trees (Document Object Model) represent the hierarchical structure of HTML pages. Each HTML tag is a node, and nested tags are children nodes.

### Steps for Building DOM Trees
1. **HTML Code Cleaning**: Balances unclosed tags and corrects errors.
2. **Tree Construction**: Uses nested HTML tags to build a hierarchical structure.

### Benefits
- DOM trees allow more precise identification of data regions and facilitate extraction based on HTML structure.

# Extraction Based on a Single List Page and Multiple Pages

## Single List Page
Extraction from a single list page involves identifying similar structures and segmenting them into individual data records.

### Key Steps
1. **Segmenting Data Records**: Detect regions of the page that contain lists of data items.
2. **Aligning Data**: Align individual data elements to create a structured output.

## Multiple Pages
When extracting from multiple pages, techniques like repeated pattern mining and template recognition help in identifying and segmenting data items.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Introduction to Schema Matching

## Overview
Schema matching is the process of identifying mappings between elements of different database schemas that have the same semantic meaning. It is crucial for integrating data from multiple sources.

### Levels of Matching
1. **Schema-Level Matching**: Considers only schema elements like names and data types.
2. **Domain and Instance-Level Matching**: Focuses on matching based on attribute values and domain information.

### Integrated Matching
Combines schema, domain, and instance data to perform comprehensive matching.

# Extracting and Analyzing Web Social Networks

## Overview
Web social networks consist of interconnected nodes representing users, pages, or entities. Analyzing these networks provides insights into user behavior and relationships.

## Key Extraction Techniques
1. **Link Analysis**: Identifies and evaluates connections between nodes.
2. **Network Visualization**: Represents social networks graphically to explore patterns and communities.

### Applications
- Social network analysis is used in recommendation systems, marketing strategies, and community detection.
