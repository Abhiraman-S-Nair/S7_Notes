# Detailed Answers to Term Paper Questions

## 17. a) Programming Model to Count Word Occurrences (8 Points)

To efficiently count the occurrences of each unique word in a document, the **MapReduce programming model** can be employed. It processes large datasets by dividing tasks into "Map" and "Reduce" phases.

### **Steps to Implement MapReduce for Word Count**
1. **Input Splitting**:
   - The document is split into smaller chunks to be processed in parallel.

2. **Mapping**:
   - Each chunk is processed by a mapper function.
   - Words are extracted and represented as key-value pairs: `(word, 1)`.

3. **Shuffling and Sorting**:
   - Intermediate key-value pairs are grouped by the key (word) and sorted.

4. **Reducing**:
   - The reducer aggregates the counts of identical keys, producing the total occurrences.

5. **Output**:
   - The result is written as a list of words with their respective counts.

### **Example Code**
```python
# Mapper Function
def mapper(document):
    words = document.split()
    return [(word, 1) for word in words]

# Reducer Function
from collections import defaultdict

def reducer(mapped_data):
    word_count = defaultdict(int)
    for word, count in mapped_data:
        word_count[word] += count
    return word_count

# Example Usage
document = "cloud computing is great and cloud computing is scalable"
mapped = mapper(document)
result = reducer(mapped)
print(result)  # {'cloud': 2, 'computing': 2, 'is': 2, 'great': 1, 'and': 1, 'scalable': 1}
